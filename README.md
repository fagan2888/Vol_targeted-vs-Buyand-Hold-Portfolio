# Vol_targeted-vs-Buyand-Hold-Portfolio
Shows backtested performance of vol targeted vs a traditional buyandhold portfolio. you can define the targeted volatility in this case I have put that as 7%. The output showns the table with shape ratio, max dd, ann returns and volatility. Ideally the vol targeted portfolio should be less volatile and have higher sharpe ratio.
